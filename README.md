## `Environment and setup`

This is my React-native project for Udacity Nano Degree.

This was tested only on iOS simulator and Apple iPhone 7 Plus. Please use iOS environment to run the app.


To install react and other packages required by the app, run 

```
yarn install
```

You need to have [Expo app](https://expo.io) or Expo command line (exp) installed on your machine to run the app.

To start the app, run 

```
yarn start
```

This will bring up the QR code, the app URL and some instructions to run the iOS simulator.

You can either open the app in the iOS simulator or test it on the physical mobile device by sending a text message to it.

```
exp start --send-to <phone number>
```

On the mobile device, you need to have the [Expo app](https://expo.io) installed. When you click on the text message, it will open this app and connect to your server.
